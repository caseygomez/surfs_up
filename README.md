**Summary:**

In conclusion the Surf Up surf and Ice Cream shop is a viable year-round business. The temperature is relatively mild with slight variabiliy throught the year. Additionally I ran two queries to examine the precipitation data for the same months to determine if rainfall would be a negative factor in the surf shop plans. Precipitation is minimal for both months with 75% of rainfull at .15 inches or less. Therefore the plans for the surf shop should continue moving forward.
